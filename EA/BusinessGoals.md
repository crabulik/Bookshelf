# Business Goals

## Context

The Bookshelf is developed in the context of the ISAC Mentoring Program, the learning platform for IT specialists that want to gain knowledge and expertise in the Software Architecture. The program provides a set of learning activities, guidelines, and access to the learning materials for its students. The entrance to the program is provided through the paid membership. The program's materials are prepared by the organizers in collaboration with mentors, who are the experts in software architecture. 

## Goal

Books are relevant sources of knowledge that can be used by students. As the number of books is significant, and the benefit of reading a specific book by a student without external help is challenging to predict, ISAC Mentoring Program must guide this process. The Bookshelf is a satellite service of the mentoring program that provides an expert view over which books are practical for achieving the desired skills for software architects.  Using the platform, students can:

- Get a book's evaluation before reading;

- See the recommendations of professionals in a specific sphere of Software Architecture;

- Identify the books that are not trustworthy or are requires a long time to read without additional value.

Another key goal of the Bookshelf is access to the ISAC Mentoring Program Library. Using the service, the students can rent a book for some time. It will eliminate the need to buy a copy of the book that can be quite expensive. The Bookshelf provides admin functions for controlling the renting process and administrating the books library.

The access to the Bookshelf service can be provided as a part of ISAC Membership or as a separate paid option. The ISAC Mentoring Program can extend the library of books by giving a portion of its budget. Because the budget is limited, growing the library requires strict control over which books will be bought, and which books are most relevant or demanded by students.
